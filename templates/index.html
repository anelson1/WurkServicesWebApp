    <h3>Janine Boduch Vainisi</h3>
    <p>"I have used the Wurk service on 3 separate occasions. Excellent!! On time, Efficient, hard working, polite. Will not hesitate to call upon them again. They moved furniture for me to my basement, my garage & other rooms. They also assisted me by emptying out a condo I had some decorating items in. They packed it up & delivered to my home. They installed some window screens & changed light bulbs. I am grateful for their excellent work."</p>
